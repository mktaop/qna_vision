# About the web app and code.
Upload a pdf and the app will convert to jpeg images which can be uploaded to a large vision model to answer questions about the content of the images.
You will need to get an API key from OpenAI and Google in order to use this code.
The code creates a streamlit webapp that can answer questions about images (and the content in those images).  For example, charts, tables, picture.
This code will work as is, if you have the necessary API keys and libraries.
Please Star this repo if you plan to use this code.  Thanks in advance.
